## Evaluation & error analysis of a machine learning tool to detect Randomized Controlled Trials
## A pilot study using articles included in Cochrane Reviews

A machine learning classifier called Tagger has been developed to predict whether an article is an RCT, based on its title, abstract, and number of authors. In this project, we will test Tagger’s predictive accuracy on 12,000 articles taken from 843 Cochrane systematic reviews. The goal of our project is: (a) to assess Tagger performance; (b) to suggest possible improvements to Tagger’s development team (our collaborators).
